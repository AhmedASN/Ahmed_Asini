Some projects I worked on.
# Algorithms:
# [Project 1: Wilson algorithm for spanning uniform tree:](https://github.com/AhmedASN/Wilson-Algorithm-for-uniform-spanning-tree)
* 1st part : A theoretical one.Basing on the loop-erased random walk model, We demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm.
* 2nd part : An implementation of the algorithm in Python 
* Results of runing the algorithm on grids of different size:
